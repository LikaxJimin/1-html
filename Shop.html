    <p>How would you feel? Thanks to you, it was so much fun to work with. Do you feel relieved by working to see you again by all means? Uh Ji-hye Actually, my personal work is sometimes extended to design work, and through design work, a topic that I want to think deeply about comes to mind. It's such a different process, but it's really fun when these two go together. So I want to keep doing it. want. The relationship with Lotte Department Store has continued after Lifestyle LAB. The first exhibition of the SPAX edition called Uh Ji-hye DANCING BLUE) was held at the Avenuel Art Hall of Lotte Department Store. At the time of the opening, 10cm performed a performance, and how much time do we usually spend on individual work on the site? Uh Wisdom It's hard to do personal work faithfully when you're busy. So, I created a community with my fellow artist friends and also showed off my own live drawings that I did in two weeks. Recently, PARTICLE), an exhibition of modeling work by designer Jun-oh Jang, was installed in the main store of Lotte Department Store, and the relationship continues. In a way, seeing our artistic diversity, we take time to discuss our work and think about new areas. I think that process whips our senses. It is no exaggeration to say that it is being shown along with Lotte Department Store. So the 10 years of the Sparks Edition have passed. How has it changed 10 years ago and today? Jang Jun-oh Well, I don't think much has changed. Although my skills have improved, the way I treat my work is the same. There are two things we wanted to protect from the very beginning: to treat our work with sincerity and to make it more enjoyable than anyone else. Even after 10 or 20 years have passed, Lotte Department Store and Sparks Edition have the same direction in 'public', 'art' and 'culture'. Jang Jun-oh Lotte Department Store attracts a variety of people, young and old, due to its nature as a department store. That's why I think I'm trying to communicate and worrying about it in various ways. We also present our own artwork, but we also design for the public. It must be a branch full of artistic sense. Seeds spread out as a design for many people. Such attempts seem to be the point where Lotte Department Store and us are right. To gently lower the boundaries of art, culture and the public. In the next 10 years, is there anything you two want to achieve? Uh Ji-hye I want to communicate with more people through various art works, because this is the ultimate purpose of designing. I think it is still on the path to that road. Maybe it was the first time the process was difficult? That Jang Jun-oh was just chasing interesting things and interesting things. So I was able to get stronger. The reason we have been able to come so far is probably because of our connections with people who have the same purpose as us. Nevertheless, there are definitely clients in design work. Also, you cannot ignore the mood or code of the client. Maybe design is communication and development through communication, so if we continue our work, we will be able to achieve our goal someday. Oh Ji-hye Jang Jun-oh What do you want to achieve together, and what do you want each of you to do? The word 'balance of life' that we wanted to include in Lifestyle LAB is also what we want to say to us more than anyone else. It's like a work of life, design, and art. Because the ideology I have has to convince my clients and everyone who witnesses this. In fact, 'I get tired of repeating a series of processes. At that time, I want to live tomorrow with the right balance in the client area. And take the time to look inside while doing no personal work. We give support to us and to all those who pursue such a life.
